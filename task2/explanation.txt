In the second task, we checked if Django signals run in the same thread as the function that calls them. 
A thread is like a worker that handles one task at a time. 
We printed the thread ID in both the view and the signal, and the output showed that both had the exact same thread ID. 
This means that the signal did not start in a new or separate workerâ€”it simply continued in the same one. 
So, yes, Django signals run in the same thread by default.
