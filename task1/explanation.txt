In the first task, we wanted to check whether Django signals are synchronous or not. "Synchronous" means that everything happens step by step, one after another. We proved this by adding a 5-second delay inside the signal function. When we triggered the signal by saving a model object through a view, we noticed that the entire process took 5 seconds to complete. This showed that Django waited for the signal to finish before moving on, which clearly proves that signals run synchronously by default.
